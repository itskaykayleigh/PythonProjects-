The objective of the recommender is to:   

	1). Train a model to recognize clothing from an image, and   
	2). Build a recommender that can recommend clothing based on images that share similar fashion styles

Image detection Â    
Image-based recommender system

**Results & Findings:**   
The model is able to classify fashion images into 10 different fashion classes, such as coat, jacket, pants, dress, skirt and etc, with an accuracy of 95%. Given an image of any style in any background, the fashion recommender was able to return 3 images of clothing in simiar styles as recommendations.

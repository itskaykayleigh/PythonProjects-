# Learning Python 
**A Portfolio of Python Projects**

These will be my forays into learning Python for data science.   
Each project will be tracked here with a quick note about what the project does. 

Below are some highlights of each project: 

**Image-Based Fashion Recommender**   

An image-based style recommender on top of a clothing classification system (95% accuracy) employing Convolutional Neural Network and Nearest Neighbors leveraging AWS and Keras with TensorFlow as backend. A demo of the recommender can be found under "Flask_App". The recommender can be used as a more effective search engine. It can also be applied to any domain that needs image content detection, tagging or image-based recommendations. 

**Personal Email Management System**   

Personalized auto email grouping system applying NLP and unsupervised ML, with a focus on clustering and dimensionality reduction (topic modeling), including PCA, NMF, LDA, t-SNE, K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering. The system aims at clustering emails into different topics based on email content to help users work more efficiently. 

**Ingredient Based Cuisine Classification**   

Applying supervised ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM and Logistic Regression, to classify cuisines from 20 countries based ingredients on recipes. 

**Domestic Movie Gross Prediction**   

Built three predictive models for 2D, 3D, and all movies applying Linear Regression with Lasso/ Ridge/ ElasticNet Regularization, each yielded an adjusted R-square of over 0.95, using data scrapped from the BoxOfficeMojo.com leveraging BeautifulSoup.
